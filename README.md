* Node SDK for interacting with the mLayer service

* mLayer (message layer) is an open, decentralized communication network that enables the creation, transmission and termination
  of data of all sizes, leveraging modern protocols. mLayer is a comprehensive suite of communication protocols designed to evolve
  with the ever-advancing realm of cryptography. Given its protocol-centric nature, it is an adaptable and universally integrable tool conceived
  for the decentralized era. Visit the mLayer [documentation](https://mlayer.gitbook.io/introduction/what-is-mlayer) to learn more.
